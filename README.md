# Tera-PVE-Bot

### Alpha Version

A Tera Proxy module that does your rotations for you.

Configurable on a per class basis.

**Requires *Command* by Pinkie Pie. You can find it [here](https://github.com/pinkipi/command) (Your proxy should come with it.)**

**If you run into any bugs/issues, please contact me on discord at Gus#0074**
